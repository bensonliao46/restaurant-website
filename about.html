    <h1>About In-N-Out Burger</h1>
    <p>
      In-N-Out Burger started in 1948 with a simple mission: serve fresh, high-quality burgers,
      fries, and shakes to customers who love classic American flavors. Over the years, it has
      become a West Coast favorite, known for its secret menu and commitment to quality ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every burger is made to order, using fresh beef, crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and
      hand-cut fries. Our focus is on providing a friendly, fast, and enjoyable dining
      experience, whether youâ€™re grabbing a quick meal or visiting with family and friends.
